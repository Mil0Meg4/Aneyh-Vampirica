# Resurgence - 
Control powers beyond your understanding and rig the cards in your favor. Obtain Primordial jokers, Augment your jokers to fit any situation, and paint your cards for even more power, and much much more as you tackle the final frontier of balatro runs: the Resurgence itself. 

Primordials - Incredibly powerful jokers, that put even legendaries to shame, obtained only through summoning the wrath of the Resurgence and facing it's perils for yourself.

Paint - Editions not enough for you? Paint has you covered, with a new modifier for your cards and jokers which can stack with editions, and give your builds some color.

Music Cards - Visual art and music often intertwine, and the Music cards are no different, weaving shifting effects that help you tune your deck to perfection by creating illegal ranks, painting cards and sequencing a new way to deckbuild, one note at a time. 

Augments - New consumables that can render jokers completely unrecognizable. Want to make a chip build with mult jokers? Turn mult into money? Spread paint everywhere in your deck? Convert sell value into raw power? Augments got you covered, with even more crafty options to break the rules and shape them to your liking.

Illegal Ranks (and more) - New ways to elevate your cards beoyond normal limits arise in the wake of the Resurgence, as every new obstacle brings a set of tools to dismantle it bit by bit. Illegal ranks range from a normal 1 all the way to 20, and bring straights to a whole new level, adding even more synergy with dedicated jokers. New strange ranks appear too, such as the 42, 69 and decimal ranks from 0.1 up until 0.9 too. 

Ancient Ranks - The fun doesn't end here, as 3 more incredibly powerful cards make their presence known: Alpha, Omega, and the elusive Gogol. Each of these can singlehandedly lead you to victory, or leave you defeated as you grasp for their power.

Darkana - Arcanas have always been... pretty basic, haven't they? this all changes now, as the Resurgence breaks into multiple different worlds to capture their inhabitants into blasphemous mockeries. Darkanas, as the name imply, are corrupted arcanas, warped beyond recognition and arguably way more useful than their original counterparts, albeit much rarer. 

Planar Jokers - Last but not least, not only trinkets were displaced by the Resurgence, but creatures and powerful artifacts too. Such is the fate of planar jokers, a crystallized version of many outerversal entities, turned into cards to use against the phenomena that holds them captive.
